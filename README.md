# FooBarQix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/StroudiWemanity/FooBarQix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/StroudiWemanity/FooBarQix)

## Statement: 

You should implement a function String compute(String) which implements the following rules.

### Step 1
If the number is divisible by 3, write “Foo” instead of the number <br>
If the number is divisible by 5, add “Bar”<br>
If the number is divisible by 7, add “Qix”<br>
For each digit 3, 5, 7, add “Foo”, “Bar”, “Qix” in the digits order.

### Step 2
We have a new business request : we must keep a trace of 0 in numbers, each 0 must be
replace par char “*“.

## Implementation:
For this Kata, I use Angular since it's my favorite in addition with Typescript.
The goal here is for me to test out some clean code principles in addition to TDD.

## Run: 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.0.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
